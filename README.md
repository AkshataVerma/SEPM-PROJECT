Restaurant Booking System is a convenient self-service table booking system that can be embedded on any website. With the restaurant reservation system, you can customize the booking process, enable people to book a table through your site, manage restaurant availability, and reservations. Easy table booking makes it easy to manage your restaurant’s table reservations. The system is implemented in a few minutes on your website, after which guests can book a table online themselves. When your restaurant is full, it can be both disruptive and time consuming to accept table reservations over the phone. With an online restaurant booking system, guests can book a table via your website. This way you are not disturbed, and guests can book a table online in peace – and then they also receive a confirmation via either e-mail or SMS. This research work aims to design and implement a remote food ordering system, through which one can order food before visiting a restaurant, book table, and also make payment.
